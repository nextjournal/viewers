  "Create a Devdoc Collection out of a set of Markdown documents

  Takes a name for the collection, a map of options, and a sequence of paths to
  markdown files, which must be on the classpath, and are resolved relative to
  the classpath.

  Documents should start with a `h1`, this is taken as the title of the
  document, and also used to determine the URL slug of the document.

  By default code blocks are simply rendered as code-blocks. The `:cljs-eval?`
  option also inlines the code block code, so it becomes part of the build and
  gets evaluated when viewing the document. `:view-source?` controls whether
  to (also) show code blocks as code (defaults to true)."
